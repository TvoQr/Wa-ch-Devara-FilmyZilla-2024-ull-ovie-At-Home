There, they encounter Bhairava "Bhaira," a formidable chieftain, and Singappa, an elder who recounts the story of Devara.

In the 1980s, Devara and Bhaira are involved in smuggling operations for Muruga, a corrupt politician. However, Devara has a change of heart when he discovers they are smuggling illegal arms. He vows to stop the trade, putting him at odds with Bhaira and other chieftains. Devara disappears after an attempt on his life, leaving behind a message that he will continue to punish those involved in smuggling.

Years later, Devara's son, Vara, grows up in his father's shadow. While Vara appears timid and averse to violence, he secretly upholds his father's legacy, masquerading as Devara to instill fear and maintain order in the Red Sea. However, Bhaira, seeking to resume smuggling, forces Vara to join his ranks, setting the stage for a clash between the two.
